# otemot

Otemot is the backend for Tometo. It's also just the word Tometo, reversed.
It's a Rust app that's powered by [Rocket](https://rocket.rs).

Here's a rough layout of the project structure:

```
.
├── gentts/ -- temporary directory for TTS generation
├── migrations/ -- SQL files for database migrations
├── src/ -- main source files
│   ├── The subfolders in this folder refer to specific application components,
│   | for example, for Statuses
│   ├── [subfolder]
│   │   ├── mod.rs -- The file that usually contains the route definition 
│   │   └── model.rs -- Business logic, meaning where the database actions usually go.
│   ├── storage/ -- Definitions and logic for storage methods (Local file storage, S3 storage, etc)
│   ├── db.rs -- Database connection stuff
│   ├── error.rs -- Where the custom Error type is defined. This saves us so many headaches, trust me 
│   ├── main.rs -- Where everything is pulled together
│   └── schema.rs -- autogenerated database schema
├── storage/ -- where generated TTS files are placed in development, instead of being uploaded
├── Cargo.toml -- manifest file, like a package.json
├── README.md -- you're reading it!
├── diesel.toml -- database manifest file
└── tts.js -- this is what generates the TTS and calls the aligner, it's called by src/handlers/status.rs
```
