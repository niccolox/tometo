# otemot

Otemot is the backend for Tometo. It's also just the word Tometo, reversed.
It's a Rust app that's powered by `actix-web`, a small web framework, and
`actix`, and asynchronous actor framework. Suffice to say, it's pretty
efficient.

Here's a rough layout of the project structure:

```
.
├── gentts/ -- temporary directory for TTS generation
├── migrations/ -- SQL files for database migrations
├── src/ -- main source files
│   ├── api/ -- API handlers, what actix-web calls when a route is visited
│   ├── handlers/ -- the async tasks that are enqueued by the API handlers
│   ├── models/ -- database & app models
│   ├── actor.rs -- the actix actor definition
│   ├── errors.rs -- custom application errors that automatically convert to HTTP responses
│   ├── main.rs -- where the server is initialized
│   ├── messages.rs -- actors communicate using messages, and this is where they're defined
│   ├── schema.rs -- autogenerated database schema
│   └── token.rs -- util file related to JWT (jsonwebtoken) parsing
├── storage/ -- where generated TTS files are placed in development, instead of being uploaded
├── Cargo.toml -- manifest file, like a package.json
├── README.md -- you're reading it!
├── diesel.toml -- database manifest file
└── tts.js -- this is what generates the TTS and calls the aligner, it's called by src/handlers/status.rs
```
