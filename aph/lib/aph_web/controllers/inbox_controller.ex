  The Inbox controller.

  Inboxes represent either unanswered or answered questions related to a single user.
  They don't actually contain any of the specifics an answer would have. They're
  created automatically by background processing whenever a new question is created,
  which is why there's not a lot in this controller â€” really the only thing that you
  can do with them that's public-facing is get their details.
