# tometo [![Build Status](https://ci.marisa.cloud/api/badges/t/tometo/status.svg)](https://ci.marisa.cloud/t/tometo)

Tometo is a social network focused on text-to-speech.

## Reporting Issues

Please report issues on the [Bug Tracker](https://bugs.marisa.cloud/projects/tometo).

## Local Setup

Tometo is functionally split into two parts â€” the frontend, which is a Vue.js
app that's kept in this repository, and the backend, which is a Rust app that's
kept in the `./otemot` folder.

In order to get the system running on your computer, you'll need some
prerequisites:

- Git
- A PostgreSQL server, and its development headers (sometimes called `libpq-dev` or `postgresql-devel`)
- Node.js, the latest LTS or Stable version should work
- Rust, the latest Stable version should work, although you do need at least
  version 1.32.0
- Python 3 and `pip`
  (plus development headers, sometimes separate as `python3-devel`)
- eSpeak (and its development headers, sometimes separate as `espeak-devel`)
- FFmpeg
- The Google Cloud SDK

After you've installed Rust, you should also install `diesel-cli`, which is what
powers our database management:

```
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

You'll also want to install `aeneas`, which parses text for us (this needs
ffmpeg and espeak installed and available):

```
pip3 install --user numpy 
pip3 install --user aeneas 
```

Then, you can clone the repository.

```
git clone https://marie.marisa.cloud/t/tometo
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done through a central config file called `config.toml`, which
provides configuration for both components. First, copy the example file:

```
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

Don't worry about your config file getting put into version control, it's ignored
by default.

The config file should have documentation for every option.

If you want to override config variables temporarily, you can set environment variables
to match them. For example, to set the `otemot.secrets.cookie` key, you would set the
`OTEMOT_SECRETS_COOKIE` variable.

### Tometo Setup

Once you're in the directoy, you'll want to install its dependencies:

```
npm install
```

There's not much more to it! We provide a couple of convenience commands for
doing stuff:

- `npm start`: Runs the frontend and watches for changes
- `npm run build`: Builds a production-ready bundles in `dist/`
- `npm run watch`: Runs and watches both the front and the backend (run `cargo install cargo-watch` first)

### Otemot Setup

First, go into the right directory:

```
cd otemot
```

Next up, to make the app aware of the database, run this command, substituting `username`,
`password` and `otemot_dev` for your own database credentials:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/otemot_dev diesel setup
```

If your database is misconfigured, the output from this command will let you
know.

Now you can back out of the directory and run the backend:

```
cd ..
cargo run
```

To watch when there's a file change, use `npm run watch` (which also watches
the frontend), but install `cargo-watch` first:

```
cargo install cargo-watch
npm run watch
```
