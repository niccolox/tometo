# Tometo

[build status](https://builds.sr.ht/~marisa/tometo?)

Tometo is a social network focused on text-to-speech. It's written in
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) using the
[Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org) web library and can generate TTS
audio from Google Cloud. The frontend is written in JavaScript using
[Vue](https://vuejs.org), with [Vue Rouer](https://router.vuejs.org) for routing
and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management.

There's other documentation on there that might be worth reading, too.

## License

Tometo is licensed under the [Prosperity public license](https://prosperitylicense.com/), meaning you
can't use it commercially. This doesn't make it Open Source software, but that
distinction is not important to us.
